# Yet Another (S)Nes Emulator
A simple NES/SNES emulator written in Rust. I plan to add support for common NES mappers and at least reach the point when I can play *Super Mario World* on SNES. Then I'll move on to the next phase.

This is basically a "training ground" for another project involving 8/16-bit era console emulation, and Rust, that I have in mind.

## Why
I'm learning Rust and I think it has the potential to be a great language. Writing an emulator is a great way to get an overall idea, because it requires several components that must interact together. On top of this, you need to add video/audio/input.
